## Bitwise experimentations

Since I'll have to keep track of consumables withdrawal symptoms, I'd rather check if I can use some bitwise operation.
Point is, there's 9 different consumables in core game + 23 additional provided by mod `WE3D - Drugs of Night City`.
Which is actually ideal for storing booleans as bits in `Int32`.

Here's a [sample made quickly on Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=6bc82273ff43eb54f43c6176048d118e), by restricting the usage of bitwise operators to [those provided by REDscript](https://wiki.redmodding.org/redscript/language/native-types#operators).

Applied to REDscript, it should roughly translate to this:

```swift
// use enum's variants value as the position in bits inside blackboard's Int32
enum Consumable {
  Invalid = -1,
  Alcohol = 0,
  MaxDOC = 1, // FirstAidWhiff
  BounceBack = 2, // BonesMcCoy
  HealthBooster = 3,
  MemoryBooster = 4,
  OxyBooster = 5,
  StaminaBooster = 6,
  BlackLace = 7,
  // so on and so forth ...
}

@addField(PlayerStateMachineDef)
public let IsWithdrawing: BlackboardID_Int; // this bad boy will contains all consumables withdrawal symptom bool, one for each bit

@addMethod(PlayerPuppet)
public func IsWithdrawing(consumable: Consumable) -> Bool {
  let blackboard: ref<IBlackboard> = this.GetPlayerStateMachineBlackboard();
  let symptoms = blackboard.GetInt(GetAllBlackboardDefs().PlayerStateMachine.IsWithdrawing);
  // get value for nth bit, where n is the consumable value (see enum above) 
  return (symptoms >> consumable) & 1;
}
public class AddictedSystem extends ScriptableSystem {
  private let player: wref<PlayerPuppet>;
  // ...
  public func SetSymptom(consumable: Consumable, withdrawing: bool) -> Void {
   if Equals(EnumInt(consumable), EnumInt(Consumable.Invalid)) { return; }
   let blackboard: ref<IBlackboard> = this.player.GetPlayerStateMachineBlackboard();
   let before = blackboard.GetInt(GetAllBlackboardDefs().PlayerStateMachine.IsWithdrawing);
   let after = before;
   if withdrawing {
     // set bit to 1
     after |= 1 << flag;
   } else {
     // set bit to 0
     after &= ~(1 << flag);
   }
   if !Equals(before, after) {
      blackboard.SetInt(GetAllBlackboardDefs().PlayerStateMachine.IsWithdrawing, next);
   }
  }
}
```
