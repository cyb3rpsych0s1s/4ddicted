## Learning about the different kind of ink game controllers

credits from psiberx:

> inkGameController has a ref to library

and later on added:

>
> inkLogicController is a lightweight controller that doesn't > have access to game or resources functions (can be attached > to any widget)

> those are fundamental, others derive from them

What I discovered way later is that for example texts in biomonitor's chemicals report (the one which displays for Sandra Dorset: hydroxyzine, tramadol, bupropion, etc) are animated with an [inkLogicController](https://jac3km4.github.io/cyberdoc/#34517) which manages an [inkAnimTextValueProgress](https://jac3km4.github.io/cyberdoc/#104202) (a.k.a [inkanimTextValueProgressInterpolator](https://nativedb.red4ext.com/inkanimTextValueProgressInterpolator) in the natives) to animate the text's value over time.

## Informations about inkMask

Some inks **cannot** be created and run in scripts, as for example `inkMask`.
So there's no point in e.g. rebuilding Sandra's Rescue .inkwidget from scratch in code since it uses a lot of them.

One can reuse the .inkwidget as-is, and just redefine the animations.

Or rebuild the .inkwidget partially in code, by still leveraging `inkMask` from the source, *to some extend* as stated by psiberx (which I have no idea up to which extend).
