## RED keywords clarifications

Asked on Discord about `const`:

- `final` means the function cannot be altered any more
- `const` means function and/or argument/parameter cannot EVER be altered and will always be the same, but you can obviously set its initial - value (no `const` variables)
- `persistent` means the values of the variables stay forever, between save games unless manually changed via code. If the variable is - declared inside a `class`, the class and variable must both be persistent for it work.
- `static` means there will only ever be one instance of the function (no static variables)
- `let` is always used for declaring variables regardless of other keywords used

  ```swift
  public const func GREAT(): String = "something great"
  ```

```swift
class ActionWeightManagerDelegate extends ScriptBehaviorDelegate
{
    const editable var actionsConditions : array< String >;
    // ...
```

you can't have `const` atm.
you can use it but it has no effect (maybe other than storing a flag in the bytecode).
