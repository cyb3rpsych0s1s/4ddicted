# Research on VFX: follow-up

WolvenKit tips when editing `.effect` and friends:

- related file(s) must be added to project even if untouched (`.mt` files)
  > e.g. when `drugged_sobel.mt` was missing for `reflex_buster`, a part of the effect disappeared.

- `.effect` / `.particle` files sometimes have tabs, with sometimes require change(s).
  > e.g. that's where to update the `Color` for `splinter_buff`.
- `.effect` has a `EmbeddedFiles` property that I couldn't find in GUI, but can be modified once converted to JSON.
  > e.g. that's where to update the `FileName` for `reflex_booster_purple.particle`.
- effect definitions are interconnected (or rather _they reference each other_, as with other Cyberpunk assets), so sometimes same change must be re-applied in many spots.
