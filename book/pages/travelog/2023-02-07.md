## Research on radial wheel

Ideally, I would like to hide the addiction-related debuffs to the player, unless V is equipped with a biomonitor.

Looking at a way to conditionally display status effects entries on top-left of the RadialWheelController, browsing the sources one will probably stumble upon:

- `UI_PlayerBioMonitorDef` from the blackboard definitions, which has a `BuffsList` and `DebuffsList` to cache the status effects.
- this cache is `Variant`, and contains `BuffInfo` entries.
- `inkCooldownGameController` uses this cache for display
  - its method `RequestCooldownVisualization` is called from `SingleCooldownManager` in `ActivateCooldown`: all these take care of preparing the ink texts and icons to display.
- and eventually `buffListGameController` is in charge of updating the buffs / debuffs lists.
